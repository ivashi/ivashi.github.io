    <p style = "width:55%; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; color:grey"> My name's Ishan Vashishta. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan planning on graduating in the spring of 2019. I’m a computer science major with intended minors in philosophy and creative writing. I started coding in high school when I dual enrolled at Central Michigan University to take an intro class in Java Programming. What programming is for me is a means for improving the lives of those around me. <br><br>

“An enlightened man had but one duty--to seek the way to himself, to reach inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led. The realization shook me profoundly, it was the fruit of this experience. I had often speculated with images of the future, dreamed of roles that I might be assigned, perhaps as poet or prophet or painter, or something similar. All that was futile. I did not exist to write poems, to preach or to paint, neither I nor anyone else. All of that was incidental. Each man had only one genuine vocation--to find the way to himself. He might end up as poet or madman, as prophet or criminal--that was not his affair, ultimately it was of no concern. His task was to discover his own destiny--not an arbitrary one--and live it out wholly and resolutely within himself. Everything else was only a would-be existence, an attempt at evasion, a
flight back to the ideals of the masses, conformity and fear of one's own inwardness.”</p><br>
